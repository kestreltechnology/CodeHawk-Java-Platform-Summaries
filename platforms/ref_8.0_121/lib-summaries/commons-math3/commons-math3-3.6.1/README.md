## Library method cpu time cost estimates: commons-math3-3.6.1

The table below shows the number of methods for which an estimated
CPU time cost was computed for a given class, and the break down of
those costs in constant cost, a range of values, or a symbolic (linenar)
expression.

### Obtained by Profiling
